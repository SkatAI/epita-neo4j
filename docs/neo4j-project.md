need to transform that into a project with deliverables

cost functions and procedures

using a mix of dataset : trees, gardens, metro, bikes

maybe also airbnb ?

gradually increase complexity

- load trees dataset
- convert geo to points
- add close_to relationship

- squirrel must go from one tree to another, minimizing distance. velocity of squirrel, time based. all start from same location ? different paths needed.

- add nuts on certain species of trees.
- squirrel must go from one tree to another, minimizing distance and maximizing nut collection. velocity of squirrel, time based. all start from same location ? different paths needed.

- add gardens
- add relation trees BELONG_TO garden
- find best garden for squirrel to live in in terms of nuts and number / size of trees

- add dogs in gardens at certain hours
- squirrel must avoid gardens with many dogs

- add chance of being attacked by a dog (squirrel dies). multi factor path of least resistance

- add transport database
- squirrel can now take the metro. new task. save his stash of nuts or something

- add restaurants database
