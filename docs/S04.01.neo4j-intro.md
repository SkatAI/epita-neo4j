Relations and questions


### Investigative journalism

The most prominent user of Neo4j for investigative journalism is the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). One such graph that was created by the ICIJ was the Panama Papers. The purpose of this graph was to identify possible corruption based upon the relationships between people, companies, and most importantly financial institutions.

Find answers to questions such as

- What are the connections between multiple companies and a family?


### Network and IT operations - cyber security

Companies use Neo4j to help them understand how information flows through a system and how components of a network are related. This is useful for planning, analysis of costs, and troubleshoot problems.

- What is the most depended-upon component?


### Transportation and logistics


supply chain management. Entities that are modeled include raw suppliers, suppliers, products, wholesalers, and retailers. All of these entities are located somewhere and there is a distance between them that will impact how quickly products can be transported.

## elements of Graph Models

- Nodes (vertices) represent entities
- Relationships (edges) represent connections

Then we add

- **Labels** for categorizing nodes
- **Properties** on both nodes and relationships

And we boost relationships with :

- types for categorizing connections
- Direction

Example : Paris Metro

- Stations are nodes
  - labels:
    - name
    - accessibility,
    - above / below ground
    - events related attributes
- between stations we have multiple types of relationships
  - BELONGS_TO_LINE
    - properties: line number, maintenance time, distance
  - PASSENGER_CONNECTS_TO
    - can be unidirectional or both ways
    - properties: distance, stairs, ...
  - CONNECTS_TO_LINE
    - properties: line number, ...

Relationship **types** (BELONGS_TO_LINE, PASSENGER_CONNECTS_TO, CONNECTS_TO_LINE) are verbs or verb phrases that describe the action, the connection between nodes. They define the semantic meaning of how nodes interact. Like verbs in sentences, they should be clear and specific about the nature of the relationship.

## Differences between properties and labels for nodes

Using the example of **metro stations as nodes** and **lines as relationships (edges)**, here’s how labels and properties differ:

**Labels**:

- Labels **categorize nodes**.
- A node can have **one or more labels** to signify its type or role.
- Example:
  - **Metro stations** might have the label `Station`.
  - If some metro stations are also RER stops, they might have an additional label `RER`.

**Example in Neo4j**:

labels then properties as key values:

```cypher
CREATE (:Metro {name: 'Porte de Choisy', zone: 1})
CREATE (:Metro:RER {name: 'Montparnasse', zone: 1})
CREATE (:Metro:RER {name: 'Gare de Lyon', zone: 1})
```

- The node `Gare de Lyon` and Montparnasse are both `Metro` and  `RER` stops.
- Labels help you run queries like:

```cypher
MATCH (s:RER)
RETURN s.name
```

This query will return all nodes labeled `RER`.

**Properties**:

- Properties store **specific details or attributes** of a node (or relationship).
- A node can have multiple key-value pairs as properties.
- Properties provide **descriptive information** about the node.

**Example in Neo4j**:

```cypher
CREATE (:Metro {name: 'Châtelet', zone: 1, open_since: 1900, lines: ['M1', 'M4', 'M7']})
CREATE (:Metro {name: 'Montparnasse', zone: 1, open_since: 1840, lines: ['M4', 'M6', 'M12', 'M13']})
```

Here, properties like:

- `name`: The name of the station.
- `zone`: The fare zone of the station.
- `open_since`: The year the station opened.
- `lines`: A list of metro lines passing through the station.

Properties help you run queries like:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Metro)
WHERE s.zone = 1 AND 'M4' IN s.lines
RETURN s.name
```

This query finds all Metro stations in Zone 1 served by Line M4.

In short:

- **Labels** classify nodes by their **type or role** (e.g., `Metro`, `RER`).
- **Properties** provide **details about individual nodes** (e.g., `name`, `zone`, `lines`).

Labels are typically used to **group nodes** for broader queries, while properties are used to **filter specific nodes** based on detailed attributes.

Labels and properties serve different purposes and have different performance implications:

**Labels**:

- Built-in indexing
- Fast for pattern matching
- Used for broad categorization
- Limited number per database
- Better query performance

**Properties**:

- Need explicit indexing
- Store specific data values
- Can have many per node
- Can be updated frequently
- More storage overhead

**Best Practice**: Use labels for characteristics you frequently search or filter by, properties for specific attributes that vary between nodes.

**Bad Practice**: Converting properties to labels like :Zone1, :HasElevator - this would bloat the label space and reduce performance.

Labels: few categories, properties : large space of key values

## Another example

Social network like X

Nodes: accounts

- labels: free, paying (certified)
- properties: account_name, photo, bio, etc

Relationship : FOLLOWS

- one direction
- properties: since, ...

Relationship : FOLLOWED_BY

- one direction
- properties: since, ...

Nodes : posts

- labels : Thread, Comment, Repost
- properties: content, likes, links, ...

relationships: LIKED_BY, REPOSTED_BY, FLAGGED_BY

## When to use a graph modedl

[TODO] humanize


Relational Databases excel when:

Your data has a stable, predictable structure that rarely changes, and relationships between entities are well-defined but not the primary focus of your queries. Think of a banking system where you have accounts, transactions, and customers. The schema is stable, data integrity is crucial, and most queries involve joining a few tables in predictable ways. Transactions need ACID compliance, and the relationships, while important, are relatively simple (one account belongs to one customer, one transaction belongs to one account).

Document Databases shine when:

Your data is naturally hierarchical and self-contained, with frequent reads but relatively few joins needed. Consider a product catalog for an e-commerce site. Each product document contains all related information: basic details, variations, images, reviews, and specifications. You rarely need to join this with other data, and the structure might vary between different product categories (clothing vs. electronics have different attributes). The schema flexibility allows you to easily add new product types without restructuring your database.

Graph Databases become the ideal choice when:

Your primary value comes from the relationships between your data, especially when these relationships form complex patterns. The Paris metro system is a perfect example: stations connect to other stations, belong to multiple lines, and you often need to find paths between points. Social networks are another classic case - finding friends of friends, or identifying influence patterns. The strength here is in traversing relationships efficiently, especially when you don't know the depth of these relationships in advance (like "find all stations reachable within 3 connections").

Consider managing a music streaming service like Spotify. You might use:

A relational database for user accounts, subscriptions, and play counts - data with clear structure and where ACID compliance matters for billing and usage tracking.

A document database for song and album information - each song document contains its metadata, lyrics, artist details, and album art. This information is usually accessed together and rarely needs complex joins.

A graph database for recommendations and music discovery - storing how songs relate to each other, what users listen to together, artist collaborations, and genre relationships. This allows complex queries like "find songs that fans of this artist also enjoy" or "discover similar artists through collaboration networks."

The key isn't choosing one type exclusively, but understanding where each model's strengths align with your specific needs. Modern applications often use multiple database types together, a pattern known as **polyglot persistence**, where each type of data is stored in the most appropriate database model.


## Benefits of graph dbs


### Natural Representation of Connected Data

Think about how we naturally describe relationships in the real world. When we talk about a metro system, we say things like "Châtelet connects to Les Halles" or "Line 1 runs through Bastille."

Graph databases mirror this natural way of thinking about connections.

In a graph, we can directly model these relationships: (Châtelet)-[:CONNECTS_TO]->(Les_Halles) or (Line_1)-[:RUNS_THROUGH]->(Bastille). This direct mapping between how we think and how we store data makes it easier to model complex domains and reason about our data.

These same relationships in relational databases would require complex join tables, in document databases nested arrays, neither of which reflects how we naturally think about these connections.

For instance, to find all stations three stops away in a relational database, you'd need multiple self-joins on a connections table – an approach that feels artificial compared to the graph's natural traversal.

### Performance on Relationship-Heavy Queries

Representing Connections in Relational database involves too many joins and result in complex and heavy SQL queries.

Graph databases truly shine when dealing with relationship-based queries, especially those involving multiple hops or complex patterns. Let's consider finding all restaurants within three metro stops of your current location. In a relational database, each "hop" requires another join operation, making the query increasingly expensive as the path length grows. The performance typically degrades exponentially with each additional join.

In contrast, graph databases use **index-free adjacency**: each node directly stores physical references to its adjacent nodes.

Traversing relationships comes down to following these references in memory, regardless of how many hops are needed.

###  Flexibility in Schema Evolution

Like with document databases, graph database offer schema flexibility.

Graph databases allow you to add new types of nodes and relationships without affecting existing queries or data. Let's say you're modeling a transportation system: you start with metro stations and their connections. Later, you want to add bike parking spaces and their relationships to metro stations.

In a graph database, you can simply start creating these new nodes and relationships without modifying any existing structures. Your queries for metro-only paths continue to work unchanged, while you can now also query for multi modal metro-bikes journeys.

This flexibility extends to properties as well. You can add new properties to certain nodes or relationships without having to modify all similar entities. For instance, if you decide to start tracking **accessibility** information for some stations, you can add those properties just to the relevant station nodes, without needing to update your entire database schema or deal with null values in a relational table.

### In short

- models relations more than spreadsheets
- super fast querying of relationships
- flexible schema
