## Path Analysis

Path Analysis examines how nodes are connected through sequences of edges, measuring distances and identifying optimal routes between nodes in a network.

- Shortest Path: Quickest route between nodes
- Average Path Length: Typical distance between any two nodes
- Diameter: Maximum distance between any two nodes
