# Neo4j Desktop

So let's switch to local with Neo4j Desktop:

- download Neo4j desktop
- stop the database (if it's running)
- create new database
- get the northwind.dump file from the course github repo

https://github.com/SkatAI/epita-neo4j/blob/master/data/northwind-50.dump

Also import the stack overflow and POLE datasets

- stackoverflow-50.dump
- pole-50.dump

All in the ./data folder

https://github.com/SkatAI/epita-neo4j/tree/master/data


All datasets come from <https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples> which has these other datasets

- https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations
- https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/legis-graph
- https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/star-wars


open the Neo4j browser

- `SHOW DATABASES;`
- `:play movies`
- `START DATABASE northwindDB;`
- `CALL db.schema.visualization();`
