## Crime Investigation - Spatial Queries - POLE dataset

- How crime data can be modeled in a graph
- How to query the graph and answer questions using Cypher
- How to refactor your data
- How to use spatial and aggregation functions in Cypher
- How to use the built-in Cypher function shortest path
- How to do conditional matches using the WHERE clause

```cypher
call db.schema.visualisation()
```

11 node types with Person has many relationships to itself


- What type of crimes were committed?
- What is the most common crime?
- What location has the highest crime rate?

```cypher
MATCH (c:Crime)
RETURN labels(c), count(c) AS total
```

Counts number of crime

Different types of crimes

```cypher
MATCH (c:Crime)
RETURN labels(c), count(c) AS total
```

labels aggregates all the labels of the node

group by type

```cypher
MATCH (c:Crime)
RETURN c.type AS crime_type, count (c) AS total
ORDER BY count(c) DESC
```

Objects involved in ccrime (as evidence)

```cypher
MATCH (o:Object)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(c:Crime)
RETURN c.type AS crime_type, count(c) AS total, o.description AS object
ORDER BY count(c) DESC
```

Persons involved in crimes

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(c:Crime)
RETURN c.type AS crime_type, count(c) AS total, p.name AS name
ORDER BY count(c) DESC
```

### Location to Point

The point data type allows you to use location-based functions in Cypher. Data Importer doesnâ€™t support natively creating point data types. In order to work with locations in the POLE dataset, you need to create a point property on the Location nodes. Currently the Location nodes have a latitude and longitude property and you can use these to create a point property.


```cypher
MATCH (l:Location)
SET l.position = point({latitude: l.latitude, longitude: l.longitude})
```

Top 20 locations for crime

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(:Crime)
RETURN l.address AS locale, l.postcode AS postcode, count(l) AS total
ORDER BY count(l) DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Geospatial


find out how much and what types of crime were committed in the vicinity of one address.

- define set the address

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
RETURN l.position AS corrie
```

- locate where the crimes were committed and calculate the distance to Coronation Street

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
WITH l.position AS corrie
MATCH (x:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(c:Crime)
RETURN x.address as crime_location,
    point.distance(x.position, corrie) AS distanceFromCoronationSt
```

point.distance()

-  filter the results : within 500 meters

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
WITH l.position AS corrie
MATCH (x:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(c:Crime)
WITH x, c, point.distance(x.position, corrie) AS distance
WHERE distance < 500
RETURN x.address AS address, count(c) AS crime_total, collect(c.type) AS crime_type, distance
ORDER BY distance desc
limit 10
```

collect() : list all types,

### Spatial Cypher Functions

https://lyonwj.com/blog/making-sense-of-geospatial-data-with-knowledge-graphs-neo4j


- point() - for creating Point instances
- point.distance() - calculates distance between two points. Can also be used for radius distance search when used in a WHERE predicate
- point.withinBBox() - to find points within a given bounding box

```cypher
RETURN point(
  {latitude:49.38713, longitude:12.12711}
)
```
