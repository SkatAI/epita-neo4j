Edsger Dijkstra

The algorithm uses a min-priority queue data structure for selecting the shortest paths known so far. Before more advanced priority queue structures were discovered, Dijkstra's original algorithm ran in Î˜ ( | V | 2 ) {\displaystyle \Theta (|V|^{2})} time, where | V | {\displaystyle |V|} is the number of nodes.

These algorithms start at a node and expand relationships until the destination has been reached. Pathfinding algorithms do this while trying to find the cheapest path in terms of number of hops or weight whereas search algorithms will find a path that might not be the shortest.
