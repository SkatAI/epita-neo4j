## Community Detection

Community Detection identifies groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network, revealing natural clusters or subgroups within the graph.

- Clustering Coefficient: How tightly clustered a node's neighbors are
- Modularity: Quality measure of community divisions
- Connected Components: Isolated subgroups in the network
